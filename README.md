### Project Overview
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Indian Premier League dataset using Python. Utilized python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. My work involved data cleaning, transforming the data and creating visualizations. Performed analysis on team performance, player statistics and match outcomes. Through this analysis, I identified the most successful teams, standout players and key factors influencing wins or losses. I provided actionable recommendations for teams and suggested specific players for product endorsements. This analysis enhanced decision-making processes and offered valuable insights for strategic planning in sports marketing.

### Business Task
To perform the Exploratory data analysis on the Indian Premier league dataset. As the sports analyst find out the most successful teams , players and factors contributing the win or loss of the team. To suggest the teams or players a company should endorse to its products.

### Data Sources
IPL Data: The primary datasets used for this analysis are "matches.csv" and "deliveries.csv" files, containing 12 years detailed information about IPL matches and each deliveries.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, several tasks were performed to ensure accurate analysis:
- Handled null values appropriately.
- Removed irrelevant columns.
- Created derived dataframe for better analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted analysis on various aspects of IPL data such as matches ,toss, batting, bowling, fielding and venue. Explored the Correlation between these aspects. Utilized visualizations like bar charts and piechart to represent findings effectively.

### Key Findings

Most succesful teams which have consistently performed well over the years winning multiple titles:
-  Mumbai Indians
-  Chennai Super Kings
-  Kolkata Knight Riders
  
Most Succesful Players with good statistics in IPL History:

- Virat Kohli
- AB de Villiers
- Chris Gayle
- MS Dhoni
- SK Raina
- DA Warner
- RG Sharma
- SL Malinga
- Harbhajan Singh
- RA Jadeja
- AD Russell
- PP Chawla
- SP Narine
- B Kumar
- GJ Maxwell
- SR Watson
- Bravo

In Last Season 2019: 
- RR pant
- JC Buttler
- Imran Tahir
- K Rabada
- HH pandya

These players have excelled on the field and also have a strong online presence, making them prime candidates for endorsements.

- When these players performed well, the team invariably clinched victory.
- Teams winning the toss and choosing to field have a higher success rate in IPL matches.
- Certain venues, such as Eden Gardens and Wankhede Stadium have hosted more matches indicating their popularity among organizers.

### Limitations

- Player endorsements might also depend on the player's fan base and popularity, which might not be fully captured in statistical analysis.
- The analysis may be based on historical data, which might not reflect current team or player capabilities accurately.
- While descriptive analysis can identify trends, it might not be sufficient for accurate predictions about future matches or player performances.
- The analysis might not consider external factors like weather conditions, injuries and Pitch conditions which can significantly impact match outcomes.
- Its hard to pick few players because the number of matches played by the players vary and some predefined parameters can make the analysis easier to some extenct.
